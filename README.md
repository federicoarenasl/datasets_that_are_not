# Datasets that Are Not Implementation and More
Initial implementation of Datasets That Are Not: Evolving Novelty Through Sparsity and Iterated Learning, published in NeurIPS 2022. 

## Aim
The aim of this repository is implementing the concept of novelty through sparsity and iterated learning with Autoencoders. Firstly we will explore the vanilla implementation from this paper, and then move on to more complex architectures and data types, such as meshes and others.
